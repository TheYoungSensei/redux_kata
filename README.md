<h1>Redux Kata</h1>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>For this small kata, you would have to implement a "simple" counter. This counter should be able to : </p>
<h5>Specifications</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Display its current value.</li>
  <li>Increment its value by one.</li>
  <li>Decrement its value by one.</li>
  <li>Double its value but with a delay of 5 seconds. Do not forget to take care of
      your user by giving him a loading feedback :).</li>
</ul>
<p>For this kata the purpose is to test the Redux ecosystem.
   So this counter should be implemented in Redux. Thus you should have in your code : </p>
<ul>
  <li>An action per event.</li>
  <li>A reducer to handle those actions.</li>
  <li>Some components to display the value of the counter and to increment/decrement/double it.</li>
  <li>A container to display the components and handle the events.</li>
</ul>
